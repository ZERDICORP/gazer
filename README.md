  > A small utility designed to semi-automatically start, restart and stop processes.
```
## How to use?

#### 1. Download [installer](https://github.com/ZERDICORP/gazer/releases/latest/download/install.sh) and run it on your machine.

Or you can simply run this command:
```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://github.com/ZERDICORP/gazer/releases/latest/download/install.sh)
```

#### 3. Create a `run.gazer` file (_there you need to write bash code to start your process like:_ `python server.py`)
#### 4. Run command `gazer` in the **same directory** where you created the `run.gazer` file.

A menu will appear, and youâ€™ll figure out the rest.

Enjoy using it! :smirk:
